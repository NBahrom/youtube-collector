I've noticed that when you're too kind, too friendly, and too social,
people start to take advantage of you.
They mistake your kindness for weakness and think they can walk all over you.
They underestimate you, assuming you're soft just because you're a good person.
But the moment they push you too far, they'll see a whole different side of you,
one they're not ready for.
If you're always being nice, always doing things for them,
they'll start expecting it.
And eventually, they'll think they can take you for granted.
That's when you need to step up and show them a side they've never seen before.
Being kind and showing love doesn't mean you have to tolerate their nonsense.
That's saying, treat people the way you want to be treated doesn't always hold up.
I can give you all the respect in the world, but if it's not returned,
I'm not obligated to keep being nice.
Some people don't deserve your kindness.
Some people need to be put in their place.
They have to learn the hard way what respect really means.
So remember, having a good heart doesn't mean you have to let people walk all over you.
